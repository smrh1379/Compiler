In this project, we were supposed to design a compiler for an Object Oriented
Language called Cool. Cool stands for Classroom Object Oriented Language
and is designed to be implemented with reasonable effort in a one-semester
course. During this project, we will cover most of its features. Note that we
have changed official Cool syntax a little bit!
The whole project consists of three main phases:
1- Scanner (or Lexical Analyzer) 2- Parser 3- Code Generator
The output of this phase – with little changes – is the input for the next
phase. The final program containing all phases must be able to get a Cool
program and generate codes ready to be run.
